# Rubric Points

## Compilation
The code has been compiled without errors using cmake and make.

## Valid Trajectories

## Reflection
There is a reflection on how to generate paths. I've put detailed comments in codes, including but not limited to
- Initialization (Macro definition)
- Initialization (```lane``` and ```ref_vel```)
- Sensor fusion parsing
- Behavior
- Trajectory build-up
